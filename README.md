# 📝 Todo App

This is a simple and responsive Todo App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks. The app uses **localStorage** to save todos persistently in the browser.

## ✨ Features
- Add new todos with a task description and an optional due date.
- Edit existing todos.
- Delete individual todos or clear all todos at once.
- Mark todos as completed or pending.
- Filter todos based on their status (All, Pending, Completed).
- Alerts to show success or error messages.
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.
- Data persistence using browser's **localStorage**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** for the structure
- **CSS3** for styling and responsiveness
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and logic
